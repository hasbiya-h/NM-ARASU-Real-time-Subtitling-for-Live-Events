# NM-ARASU-Real-time-Subtitling-for-Live-Events
Introduction :
In an increasingly global and inclusive environment, real-time subtitling has emerged as
a powerful tool for enhancing accessibility and audience engagement during live events.
Whether for individuals with hearing impairments or non-native language speakers, real-time
subtitles provide an immediate textual representation of spoken content, bridging
communication gaps.
This project focuses on developing a real-time subtitling system using automatic speech
recognition (ASR) and natural language processing (NLP) technologies. The system captures
live audio from events, transcribes it instantly, and displays synchronized subtitles to the
audience.

Problem Statement :
Live events often lack accessibility features such as subtitles, limiting participation for
diverse audiences. Manual transcription is slow, expensive, and prone to delays, making it
unsuitable for dynamic, real-time environments. This project addresses the need for a
scalable, accurate, and automated solution for live subtitling.

Objectives :
Enhance Accessibility: Provide real-time subtitles to support hearing-impaired users and
multilingual audiences.
Automate Transcription: Replace manual efforts with AI-driven speech recognition for faster
and consistent results.
Improve Audience Engagement: Increase inclusivity and comprehension during live
broadcasts, conferences, and public events.

Methodology:
Problem Analysis: Assessed the challenges in live event accessibility and the limitations of
manual subtitling.
Audio Capture and Processing: Integrated real-time audio feed from live events for speech
input.
Speech Recognition Engine: Utilized tools like Google Speech-to-Text API or DeepSpeech to
transcribe spoken words into text.

Subtitle Formatting: Applied NLP techniques for punctuation, sentence segmentation, and
delay minimization.
Display and Sync: Designed a user interface for displaying synchronized subtitles on screens
or personal devices.
Testing and Validation: Conducted pilot tests at mock events to measure latency, accuracy,
and user feedback.

Sample Code:
from google.colab import files
import zipfile, os, time import
speech_recognition as sr

Upload and extract ZIP uploaded =
files.upload() zip_file =
list(uploaded.keys())[0] extract_path =
"live_audio" with zipfile.ZipFile(zip_file, 'r')
as zip_ref:
zip_ref.extractall(extract_path)
recognizer = sr.Recognizer() subtitle_file =
"live_subtitles.txt"

Find all wav files audio_files = [] for root, _,
files_in_dir in os.walk(extract_path): for file in
sorted(files_in_dir):
if file.lower().endswith(".wav"):
audio_files.append(os.path.join(root, file))
with open(subtitle_file, "w", encoding="utf-8") as f: f.write("===
Live Subtitles ===\n")

for filepath in audio_files: with
sr.AudioFile(filepath) as source:
audio = recognizer.record(source) try:
text = recognizer.recognize_google(audio)
timestamp = time.strftime('%H:%M:%S')
print(f"[{timestamp}] {text}") with open(subtitle_file,
"a", encoding="utf-8") as f: f.write(f"[{timestamp}]
{text}\n") except sr.UnknownValueError:
print(f"[{time.strftime('%H:%M:%S')}] Could not understand.") except
sr.RequestError as e:
print(f"[{time.strftime('%H:%M:%S')}] API error: {e}") time.sleep(1)
Input Format:
A ZIP file containing one or more .wav audio files representing audio segments to be
transcribed.

Output Format:
A plain text file named 'live_subtitles.txt' containing timestamped subtitles in the
following format:
[HH:MM:SS] Transcribed speech text

Result :
The system successfully transcribed each audio segment and appended the recognized text
with timestamps to the subtitle file, simulating live subtitle generation.
Sample Output:
Testing and Validation:
The system was tested with multiple WAV files of varying lengths and speech clarity.
Recognition accuracy was validated by comparing transcribed text to the original
speech. Error handling was tested by including noisy and silent audio clips.

Conclusion:
The implementation of a real-time subtitling system significantly enhances the inclusivity
and accessibility of live events. By leveraging speech recognition and NLP, this solution
offers a reliable and scalable approach to live transcription. Future improvements could

involve multilingual translation and speaker identification for even broader applications.
